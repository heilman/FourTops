Basic Recipe for running Analysis:

-Compile TopTreeProducer and TopTreeAnalysisBase
-run './CompileMacro' in the FourTops directory.  This compiles TopTree_EventSelection_Run2.cc and creates the MACRO executable.
-run 'python LaunchParallelMacro.py'  This reads from config/Run2_samples.xml, parses the entries there and then launches a different instance of the macro over each dataset on each core available on the machine.
