##Some general shell commands
STR="Hello World!"
echo $STR    
echo ">> script.sh is checking where it is"
pwd
echo ">> script.sh is checking how much disk space is still available"
df -h
echo ">> script.sh is listing files and directories in the current location"
ls -l
echo ">> script.sh is listing files and directories in userdir on storage element"
ls -l /pnfs/iihe/cms/store/user/$USER

##When accessing files on the storage element it is imporant to execute your code on the /scratch partition of the workernode you are running on. Therefore you need to copy your executable which is accessing/writing root files onto the /scratch partition and execute it there. This is illustrated below.

echo ">> cd into /scratch partition"
cd /scratch
echo ">> ls of /scratch partition"
ls -l

##Create a small root macro

echo "{
  TFile *MyFile = new TFile(\"testfile.root\",\"RECREATE\"); 
  MyFile->ls();
  MyFile->Close(),
  //TFile* f=TFile::Open(\"dcap://maite.iihe.ac.be:/pnfs/iihe/cms/store/user/$USER/testfile.root\");
 // f->ls();
 // f->Close();
} 
" > rootScript.C

cp rootScript.C  /localgrid/keaveney/limitsetting

cat rootScript.C

echo ">> set root"
